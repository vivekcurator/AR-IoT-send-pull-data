PROBLEM : Imagine you work in a thermal power plant and there is an emergency where a valve of heating system has broken. you are the in-charge of repairing that valve but due to high heat you are facing problems. If your company was using the idea that i am going to discuss next, this task would be very simple to perform.

SOLUTION : We've created an IoT and augmented reality system that can be used to operate devices without requiring physical interaction.To create a prototype of our concept, we used basic and open source platforms. The prototype includes two gadgets that are meant to showcase the notion of utilising an AR interface to operate and obtain data from an IoT device.
